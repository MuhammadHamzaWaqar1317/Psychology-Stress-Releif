	<center><h1>Perceived Stress Scale</h1></center>
	<p>A more precise measure of personal stress can be determined by using a variety of instruments that 
have been designed to help measure individual stress levels. The first of these is called the Perceived 
Stress Scale.
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a classic stress assessment instrument. The tool, while originally 
developed in 1983, remains a popular choice for helping us understand how different situations affect 
our feelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask about your feelings and thoughts 
during the last month. In each case, you will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain 
way. Although some of the questions are similar, there are differences between them and you should 
treat each one as a separate question. The best approach is to answer fairly quickly. That is, donâ€™t try to 
count up the number of times you felt a particular way; rather indicate the alternative that seems like 
a reasonable estimate</p>
